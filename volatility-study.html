                <h2>1. The Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    This project investigates a well-known market anomaly: the <strong>"volatility crush"</strong> associated with corporate earnings announcements. The objective was to empirically test the hypothesis that <strong>realized volatility</strong> consistently rises before an earnings report (as anticipation and uncertainty build) and sharply collapses immediately after (as the new information is released and uncertainty is resolved).
                </p>
    
                <h2>2. Methodology: Event Study Design</h2>
                <p>
                    An event study was designed using a sample of high-volume tech stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) from the S&P 500. The methodology focused on isolating the volatility impact of the earnings event itself.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The process, executed in a Python/Jupyter Notebook, was as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Sourcing:</strong> Historical daily price data was acquired via the <strong>yfinance</strong> library. Quarterly earnings announcement dates for the past 5 years were collected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volatility Calculation:</strong> A <strong>20-day rolling realized volatility</strong> (annualized standard deviation of log returns) was calculated for each stock to create a time series.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Centering:</strong> For each earnings event, a time window from -30 to +30 trading days was created (where Day 0 is the earnings date). The volatility data for each event was "centered" on this window.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Finally, the volatility series from all events and all stocks were averaged using NumPy to create a single, clear plot showing the "average" volatility behavior around an earnings announcement.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>3. Analysis: The 'Volatility Crush' Effect</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary analysis involved visualizing the aggregated event data. The results, as shown in the chart, provide clear quantitative evidence for the 'volatility crush' phenomenon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plot demonstrates a clear run-up in volatility in the ~15 days preceding the announcement, peaking on Day -1, followed by an immediate and significant drop on Day 0 and Day +1. This pattern confirms the market's behavior of "pricing in" uncertainty, which then vanishes the moment the new information becomes public.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The plot below charts the average 20-day realized volatility for a stock, centered around its earnings announcement (Day 0).
